# Python-and-R
This portfolio contains final projects and assignments from two of my economics courses: Probability and Statistics for Economists (ECON 220) and Econometrics (ECON 320). 

In the case of assignments, students were expected to recreate an html provided by the instructor and experiment with packages/functions in a particular programming  language. 

For final projects, students were allowed to work independently or in groups for our ECON 220 course; however, students were expected to collaborate on the final project for ECON 320. 

As a result, these projects reflect my ability to work independently and in a group\team.


## R Programming Language 

### Assignments
These files, imported as .Rmd, contain the code I used to recreate the html file we were assigned for a given week. 

Topics included:
* Modifying data with dplyr
* Using ggplot
* Grouping 
* Factoring 
* Creating tables 
* Creating graphs
* Performing T-tests
* Etc.

### Final Project
For the final project, students were expected to use the data collected from a class survey (taken at the beginning of the semester) to test our preliminary hypotheses and draw conclusions about the population.
This required that I perform the following: 
* Data cleaning 
* Data filtering
* Variable Renaming  
* Factoring to create levels
* Applying T-tests
* Creating tables
* Creating graphs
* Etc. 

## Python Programming Language 

### Assignments
These files, imported as .ipynb, contain the code I used to recreate the html file we were assigned for a given week.

Topics included:
* Simple regression 
* Multiple regression
* Covariance 
* Multicollinearity
* Inference
* Qualitative variables
* Covariance  
* Creating crosstab tables, pivot tables, and other summary statistics 
* Data visualization 
* Etc.

### Final Project 
For the final project, I was in charge of creating data visualizations (scatterplots, heat maps, etc.) to present our summary statistics, performing F-Statistics (joint significance, overall significance, etc.), testing qualitative variables, and testing variable interactions. I presented the hypotheses and results from these tasks using Stargazer as well as markdown on Jupyter notebook. 

I also assisted in finding the data set used for the assignment and I set up the DropBox folder that my teammates and I used to collaborate on the same Jupyter notebook.
